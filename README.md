Operational SuperDARN Radar Operating System hardware control for MSI-like radar control systems


This repository houses the operational code for the MSI-like radar designs. 

Repository structure;
mainline is a reference operational code branch
each radar will have its own operational branch.
as well as a pre-deployment development branch for experimental changes.

Expect hot fixes to show up first on operational branches. So Radar ops, watch the commit logs looking for patches you may want to apply to your radar.

Expect to see a lot of churn here while I gather the operational code for each radar up into this repository.
